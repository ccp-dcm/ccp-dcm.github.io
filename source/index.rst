Towards a CCP on Data-centric Computational Mechanics
=====================================================

This is a `collaborative computational community
<https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/collaborative-computational-communities-towards-new-ccps/>`__
centred around the FEniCS and Firedrake finite element systems. `FEniCS
<https://fenicsproject.org>`__ and `Firedrake <https://firedrakeproject.org>`__
are world-leading software frameworks for the numerical solution of partial
differential equations (PDEs). These numerical simulations are essential for
advancing science and engineering across a very broad range of disciplines.
FEniCS and Firedrake are used to develop solvers in the geosciences (ocean,
atmosphere, cryosphere, geodynamics), nuclear fusion (plasma, tritium
transport, breeding blankets), physiology and medicine (brain, heart), and many
more besides.
